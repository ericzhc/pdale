Using intrasyc's PDA, this unix-based platform allows communication between from a delivery center and it's mobile units. It's purpose is to optimize the package delivery by continously calculating the shortest path to the next package to deliver. The system also supports messaging between each unit and the central. It also supports a barcode reader as an input and a GPS to localize the units on the road. Data is transfered using a cellular module. Code should work out-of-the-box by simply deploying the executable on a CerfPDA.
